# COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker

This project is a data analysis and visualization notebook that tracks COVID-19 trends (cases, deaths, and vaccinations) across selected countries. The goal is to uncover key patterns and insights from the pandemic data using Python data tools.

---

##  Project Objectives

- Load, clean, and explore the global COVID-19 dataset.
- Visualize trends in total cases, new cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Identify correlations and anomalies using line charts, bar charts, and heatmaps.
- Summarize key insights from the data.

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly (for interactive choropleth maps)
- Git/GitHub

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-data-tracker.git
   cd covid19-data-tracker

2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly

3. Download the dataset from Our World in Data, and save it as:
    ```bash
    owid-covid-data.csv

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook COVID-19 Global Data Tracker.ipynb

## Insights from COVID-19 Data

    1. India had the highest total number of COVID-19 cases among the selected countries, followed by the United States.
    2. Kenya maintained a relatively lower death rate, indicating either a younger population or better containment in early phases.
    3. The United States had the fastest early vaccine rollout, but India caught up mid 2021.
    4. A noticeable spike in new cases was observed in India during mid-2021, which may correspond with the Delta variant outbreak.
    5. Nigeria had consistently low reported case counts, which could indicate underreporting or successful mitigation strategies.

## Reflections
This project helped me improve my data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling skills using real world health data. I also gained experience interpreting patterns and communicating findings clearly through visualizations and markdown documentation.
